**felix-ml** is a machine learning approach for quickly generating diffraction patterns from a given specimen and predicting properties of the specimen when instead given the diffraction pattern.

Built using PyTorch.


### datasets

| purpose | size | description |
|---------|------|-------------|
|CVAE|12k|pairs of lattice images alongside the corresponding diffraction pattern image generated (specimen all with the same thickness)|
|CNN|N/A|N/A|
